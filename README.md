Capturing and exporting telemetry data from modern cloud applications can be difficult and complicated. OpenTelemetry simplifies observability so you can collect telemetry from applications and services, allowing for analysis with a growing range of observability backends. It is now the second largest project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation after Kubernetes (based on contributions) and it’s quickly becoming the key observability toolset for operators, SREs and developers. It provides a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs for capturing metrics, distributed traces, and logs from applications to help you analyze your software’s performance and behavior. In this course, Daniel Khan shows you how to set up, configure, deploy, and analyze data from OpenTelemetry to gain actionable insights into your application performance.
